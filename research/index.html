	<p> Here is some info about my research! I really like research. Especially when it involves cool swirlies, glowy dye, and supercomputers. </p>
	<h2> Taylor Dispersion in Capillaries with Triangular Cross-Sections </h2>
	<h3> With: Dr. Francesca Bernardi, Professor Rich McLaughlin, and Professor Roberto Camassa </h3>
      	<p> In this project we investigate the effect of triangular cross-sectional geometries on the evolution 
		of a passive tracer injected in a capillary subject to laminar background flow. 
		The role of the cross-sectional geometry in determining the skewness of the tracer concentration distribution 
		at short and long times is of particular interest, as skewness is a measure of the asymmetries of the distribution. This topic is of interest due to applications 
		to microfluidics, drug delivery, and chemotaxis. 
		Over the course of this project, we have set up and conducted an experiment to gather data on the evolution of a passive tracer injected in an equilateral 
		triangle capillary and compared the tracer distribution to numerical simulations. We have also developed theoretical and numerical methods to solve a Poisson's problem for Stokes flow in
		an equilateral and isosceles capillaries.  We are currently preparing a manuscript for submission to <i> Physical Review Fluids </i>. </p>
