	<p> Here is some info about my research! I really like research. Especially when it involves cool swirlies, glowy dye, and supercomputers. </p>
	<h2> Taylor Dispersion in Capillaries with Triangular Cross-Sections </h2>
	<h3> With: Dr. Francesca Bernardi, Professor Rich McLaughlin, and Professor Roberto Camassa </h3>
      	<p> In this project we investigate the effect of triangular cross-sectional geometries on the evolution 
		of a passive tracer injected in a capillary subject to laminar background flow. 
		The role of the cross-sectional geometry in determining the skewness of the tracer concentration distribution 
		at short and long times is of particular interest, as skewness is a measure of the asymmetries of the distribution. This topic is of interest due to applications 
		to microfluidics, drug delivery, and chemotaxis. 
		Over the course of this project, we have set up and conducted an experiment to gather data on the evolution of a passive tracer injected in an equilateral 
		triangle capillary and compared the tracer distribution to numerical simulations. We have also developed theoretical and numerical methods to solve a Poisson's problem for Stokes flow in
		an equilateral and isosceles capillaries.  We are currently preparing a manuscript for submission to <i> Physical Review Fluids </i>. </p>
	<h2> Dynamics of Pulsing Soft Corals </h2>
	<h3> With: Professor Shilpa Khatri, Matea Santiago, and Professor Laura A. Miller </h3>
     	<p> Soft corals of the family Xeniidae significantly enhance the photosynthetic capacity of their symbiotic algae by actively pulsing to generate 
		flow in their surrounding fluid. Fluid drawn towards the coral mixes at a sufficiently slow rate to allow for the removal of photosynthetic
		waste and then the fluid is transported away from the coral polyp. This active motion combined with the fact that these soft corals exist in
		a fluid regime where both inertial and viscous forces influence the flow makes them a unique model organism for understanding fluid mixing. 
		In this project we use the Immersed Boundary Finite Elements (IBFE) method to solve the fully-coupled three-dimensional fluid-structure 
		interaction problem of a pulsing coral and its generated flow. We study the resulting 
		fluid flow and mixing patterns as we vary parameters of the problem. Additionally, we analyze how the characteristic vertical and horizontal 
		velocities of the generated flow change as we vary the Reynolds number and the length of the resting time period between pulses.</p>
