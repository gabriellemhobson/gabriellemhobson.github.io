	<p> Here is some info about my research! I really like research. Especially when it involves cool swirlies, glowy dye, and supercomputers. </p>
	<h2> Taylor Dispersion in Capillaries with Triangular Cross-Sections </h2>
	<h3> With: Dr. Francesca Bernardi, Professor Rich McLaughlin, and Professor Roberto Camassa </h3>
      	<p> In this project we investigate the effect of triangular cross-sectional geometries on the evolution 
		of a passive tracer injected in a capillary subject to laminar background flow. 
		The role of the cross-sectional geometry in determining the skewness of the tracer concentration distribution 
		at short and long times is of particular interest, as skewness is a measure of the asymmetries of the distribution. 
		Over the course of this project, we have set up and conducted an experiment to gather data on the evolution of a passive tracer injected in an equilateral 
		triangle capillary and compare the tracer distribution to numerical simulations. We have also developed theoretical methods to solve a Poisson's problem for Stokes flow in
		an equilateral capillary using complex variables techniques. Additionally, we have extended our work to isosceles triangle geometries and numerically solved 
		Poisson's problem using the finite elements method in varying isosceles triangle domains. These results have showed a change in the loading behavior of a passive 
		tracer in capillaries with isosceles triangle cross-sections, corresponding to a sign-change in the skewness from positive to negative. We are currently preparing a 
		manuscript for submission to <i> Physical Review Fluids </i>. </p>
