	<h2> Taylor Dispersion in Capillaries with Triangular Cross-Sections </h2>
	<h3> With: Dr. Francesca Bernardi, Professor Rich McLaughlin, and Professor Roberto Camassa </h3>
      	<p> In this project we investigate the effect of triangular and trefoil cross-sectional geometries on the evolution 
		of a passive tracer injected in a capillary subject to laminar background flow. 
		The role of the cross-sectional geometry in determining the skewness of the tracer concentration distribution 
		at short and long times is of interest because skewness is a measure of the asymmetries of the distribution. This topic has applications 
		to microfluidics, drug delivery, and chemotaxis. 
		Over the course of this project, we have conducted experiments on the evolution of a passive tracer injected in an equilateral 
		trefoil capillary and compared the tracer distribution to numerical simulations. We have also developed theoretical and numerical methods to solve 
		a Poisson's problem for Stokes flow in an equilateral and isosceles capillaries.  We are currently preparing a manuscript for submission to <i> Physical Review Fluids </i>. </p>
	<h2> Dynamics of Pulsing Soft Corals </h2>
	<h3> With: Professor Shilpa Khatri, Matea Santiago, and Professor Laura A. Miller </h3>
     	<p> Soft corals of the family Xeniidae significantly enhance the photosynthetic capacity of their symbiotic algae by actively pulsing to generate 
		flow in their surrounding fluid. Fluid drawn towards the coral mixes at a sufficiently slow rate to allow for the removal of photosynthetic
		waste and then the fluid is transported away from the coral polyp. These soft corals are a unique model organism for understanding fluid mixing. 
		In this project we use the Immersed Boundary Finite Elements (IBFE) method to solve the fully-coupled three-dimensional fluid-structure 
		interaction problem of a pulsing coral and its generated flow. We study the resulting 
		fluid flow and mixing patterns as we vary parameters of the problem, such as the Reynolds number and the length of the resting time period between pulses.</p>
