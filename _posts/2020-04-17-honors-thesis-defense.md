I am very pleased to have successfully defended my undergraduate Honors Thesis, 'Evolution of a Passive Tracer in Capillaries with Triangular Cross-Sectional Geometries'.
I would like to thank Dr. Francesca Bernardi for her guidance and support, as well as my thesis advisors, Professor Rich McLaughlin and Professor Roberto Camassa, 
and thesis committee member Professor Pedro SÃ¡enz.
