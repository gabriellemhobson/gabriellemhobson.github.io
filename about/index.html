	<h1>About</h1>
	<p> I'm a first-year graduate student researcher at Scripps Institution for Oceanography at UCSD.
		I have graduated with a B.S in Applied Mathematics from UNC Chapel Hill, where I conducted fluid dynamics research on Taylor dispersion in capillaries in the  Joint Applied Math and Marine Sciences 
	Fluids Lab under the guidance of Dr. Francesca Bernardi, Professor Rich McLaughlin and Professor Roberto Camassa. 
	Over the past two years, I have also conducted research using numerical simulations of pulsing soft corals in Professor Shilpa Khatri's lab in the Applied Mathematics Group at UC Merced.  </p>
	<p> Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, photography and cooking. </p>
