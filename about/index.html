	<h1>About</h1>
	<p> I'm a first-year graduate student researcher at Scripps Institution for Oceanography at UCSD.
		I have graduated with a B.S in Applied Mathematics from UNC Chapel Hill, where I conducted fluid dynamics research in the  Joint Applied Math and Marine Sciences 
	Fluids Lab under the guidance of Professor Rich McLaughlin and Professor Roberto Camassa. 
	Over the past two years, I have also conducted fluid dynamics research in Professor Shilpa Khatri's lab in the Applied Mathematics Group at UC Merced.  </p>
